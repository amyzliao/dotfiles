These things live in root `~/`:
```
.skhdrc
.yabairc
.config
```

The `vscode-config/User` just holds my vscode User `keybindings.json` and User `settings.json` files.

I use:
- [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/wiki) tiling window manager
  - I use [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) to define my yabai shortcuts
  - I use [jq](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/jq) for the crazier shortcuts
  - I have [disabled SIP](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/wiki/Disabling-System-Integrity-Protection)
  - I have configured scripting addition
- [the neovim vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asvetliakov.vscode-neovim)
- [the which key vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VSpaceCode.whichkey)

It's also important to note:
- my globe key is rebound to command
- my command key is rebound to ctrl
- my ctrl key is rebound to globe
- my option key is still option

Bugs:
none :)
